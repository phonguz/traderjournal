The aim of the application is to create an electronic trading journal that will facilitate  trade record keeping, equity / account tracking.

The application will be trading platform / market agnostic, this means you can use it with any market, any currency.

The ability to create trades, trade events (with supporting descriptions and images (most obviously screenshots of trade entry / exits)).
Reporting : PDF view of a single trade through it's lifecycle... ie. entry / stoploss / takeprofit / partial close and ultimately close.

The application is built using the Eclipse RCP framework, and hsqldb as data store.

**Lots of work still to be done.**

TODO:
Add accounts, track account pl., Reporting ( PDF ), multiple currency support.
